# External-Apex-Cheat
update: fixed blue-screens and usermode closing.

update 2: Fixed Glow flickering and random crashes..

news: Game Updated + Ban Wave. possible detection (use at own risk)

Install WDK
1) Build in Release x64
2) Map driver using KDMapper
3) Launch Game
4) Run User-mode when in main menu
5) Have Fun 

driver is indeed public/open source (anyone can use it) made by null, so plz dont think some shitty CW trainer really made this...
glow was made by @AdrianVPL, any p2c use this or skidded version's of it. myself put this together too provide a simple cheat people can use while it stays UD
if your any good with function hooking in kernel you could possibly make this a better driver.

my discord if you have issue :  $urge got tapped#4481

if your on 2004 download the supported kdmapper found on the interwebs somewhere.. not rocket science ;)
enjoy 

updated to new game version

status: Undetected (0 ban reports past week)

small bugs fixed
